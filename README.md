# HellbenderEngine

This is HellbenderEngine, It is no where near being finished.My goal with HellbenderEngine is primary to learn about engine developement.

For now  it only support Opengl rendering but I plan to tinker with Vulkan support somewhere in the future.

Checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/Goutch/HellbenderEngine/wiki) for code examples.
