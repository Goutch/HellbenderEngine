# HellbenderEngine

This is HellbenderEngine, It is no where near being finished. my goal with HellbenderEngine is primary to learn about engine developement.

For now  it only support Opengl rendering but I plan to tinker with Vulkan support somewhere in the future.

Only Linux(gcc) and Windows(mingw) is tested.
