# HellbenderEngine

This is HellbenderEngine, an engine made with the knowledges I gained while tinkering over the years.
It is no where near being finished. The goal of HellbenderEngine is primary to learn about engine developement.

For now  it only support Opengl rendering but I plan to tinker with Vulkan support somewhere in the future.

Only Linux(gcc) and Windows(mingw) is tested.
